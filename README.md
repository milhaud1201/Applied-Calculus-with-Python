**SymPy** is a Python library for working with mathematical expressions in **symbolic** form.

We have seen that Python variables must be assigned a value. However, in math, variables are often used to represent unknowns. `Symbolic computation` allows us to manipulate expressions with variables that are not assigned a value.

Symbolic computation also retains the exact value of expressions, rather than rounding them to decimals. 

The alternative to symbolic computation is `numerical computation`. In numerical computation, all values are represented as either integers or floating-point numbers.
